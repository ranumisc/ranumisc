  hi i'm rance pls im cool trust int int int int int int int
  or not, up 2 u haha
this basically like my friendship resume /silly

also the following stuff is like HELLA yap

<details>
<summary>things to know</summary>

**BYF/I**
  i am a typically shy individual and may come off as distant (i'm so sorry if i hurt you feelings ignorantly). i get HIGHLY ANXIOUS when socializing - but there are rare moments i will interact first. sometimes i go <sub>semi/non-verbal</sub>, but honestly it's never for a major reason; i probably just don't feel like typing.
  <sub>**i have a hard time making/keeping friends, i'm genuinely sorry(again) if i say anything that kills the mood.**</sub>

**IWC + DNI**
generally don't really care about fandoms anymore-- i'm resorting to just freely block. obvious *basic dni criteria*. i don't care about ragebaiters/trollers honestly it's 50/50 i'll joke back, if not, i just won't respond. i'm not big on arguing haha

probably the one thing i won't tolerate is people who support/make skins of controversial games/creators. i don't care if it's just a 'joke', there are limits to everything.

also if you're under 13 or over 20, i recommend *iwc*.

<details>
  <summary>focused abt me</summary>
  
  hi i'm rance, use **she**her pronouns primarily / rarely use *they*. please avoid using masc terms for me.

  i'm **16**, so please (try) to refrain from nsfw stuff if u int. also speaking of this i'm ace :).

  besides me being an anxious abomination of panic, there isn't really any need to walk on eggshells around me. unless you're in the iwc list. i'm not *the type to get offended/upset* at lot, and don't really care about anything (in terms of affecting me).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>where else you can find me</summary>

  **GITHUBS** ***@ranujet*** *@crimealley* both me. if u wanna follow git just follow main cuz my alts will ALWAYS be privated.

  **DISCORD** *@ranujet* literally just my main usertag. i'm sort of inactive online anyways but this is your best bet to contact me :')
