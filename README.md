  <summary>about me</summary>

**BIO**
i am 16yo, filipino-chinese, and have two younger brothers (found family): @spring-fever and @cinnamonshut.

**interests**
roblox is not my main interest, as phighting is just a hyperfixation of mine. my main interests are ultrakill, transformers and comics (primarily DC and invincible). <sub>a list of other stuff i like but irrelevant: RHYTHM GAMES (i don't associate with the fandom), MC ARGs, ROBLOX MYTHS, POKEPASTA + CREEPYPASTA + MARBLE HORNETS.</sub>

yeah a lot of these i just come back to.. in summary i'm a stupid teenager who likes pvp games with fire soundtracks, comics and robots.
