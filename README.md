<summary>things to know</summary>

**BYF/I**
  i am a typically shy individual and may come off as distant (i'm so sorry if i hurt you feelings ignorantly). i get HIGHLY ANXIOUS when socializing - but there are rare moments i will interact first. sometimes i go <sub>semi/non-verbal</sub>, but honestly it's never for a major reason; i probably just don't feel like typing.
  <sub>**i have a hard time making/keeping friends, i'm genuinely sorry(again) if i say anything that kills the mood.**</sub>

**IWC + DNI**
generally don't really care about fandoms anymore-- i'm resorting to just freely block. obvious *basic dni criteria*. i don't care about ragebaiters/trollers honestly it's 50/50 i'll joke back, if not, i just won't respond. i'm not big on arguing haha

probably the one thing i won't tolerate is people who support/make skins of controversial games/creators. i don't care if it's just a 'joke', there are limits to everything.

also if you're under 13 or over 20, i recommend *iwc*.
